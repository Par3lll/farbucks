                <h1>Our Heritage</h1>
                <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Far Far Away. It was here where FARBUCKS opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>

                <h1>Coffee & Craft</h1>
                <p>It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee cherries, to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the barista who serves it with care. We are committed to the highest standards of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to create new experiences to savor.</p>

                <h1>Our Partners</h1>
                <p>We like to say that we are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business serving coffee. Our employees who we call partners are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. We are committed to making our partners proud and investing in their health, well-being and success and to creating a culture of belonging where everyone is welcome.</p>
